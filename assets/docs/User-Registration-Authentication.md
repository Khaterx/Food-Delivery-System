## 6. Main Flow

## Registration

1. User submits signup form: username, email, password.
2. System validates fields (format, duplicates, strength).
3. Password is hashed.
4. User is saved to database; default role assigned.
5. (Optional) Verification email/OTP sent.
6. User receives registration confirmation.

## Login

1. User submits credentials (email/username, password).
2. System validates credentials.
3. On success, a session/JWT is created.
4. User is redirected to dashboard.
5. On failure, error message is shown.

## Forgot/Reset Password

1. User submits ‚ÄúForgot password‚Äù.
2. System sends reset link or OTP.
3. User sets a new password using the token/OTP.
4. System updates the user‚Äôs password.

## 7. Validation and Security

- **Password**: Min length, complexity checks, hashed (e.g., bcrypt).
- **Email/Username**: Uniqueness and format checked.
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, account lockout on brute-force.
- **Sessions**: Tokens/cookies must be secure, may have timeouts/invalidation.

## 8. Error Handling

| Scenario                 | Error Message/Response          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |

| Duplicate email/username | 409 Conflict ("Already exists") |
| Incorrect password       | 401 Unauthorized                |
| Account locked/disabled  | 403 Forbidden                   |
| Verification required    | 401 Unauthorized ("Verify...")  |

## Notes
- Every user gets a cart (created at registration or first item add).    
- Redis memory DB may cache user/carts for high performance.
- All user actions (login, logout, register, reset, etc.) should be audited.
